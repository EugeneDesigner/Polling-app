#Polling app

I wanted to learn Socket.io. So, I have built this small app while googling, looking at different tutorials, similiar apps. But it became boring, so I decided for my end-result to conceptualize it a bit and make my app work and look like a real application, starting from design and finishing with the easy-to-learn functionality. It is far from being a real application, but it can be a good starting point. But for me it is time to move further.

##Used technologies

* Socket.io
* React
* Node
